TUTORIAL 1: CHECKING STRINGS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[X] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any string-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [X] YES - Question #(s): 1, 2
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 4


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [X] str_to_lower() - standardize capitalization
   [ ] str_to_upper() - standardize capitalization  
   [ ] str_trim() - remove leading/trailing whitespace
   [X] str_replace() - fix typos or inconsistent spellings
   [ ] Other: ___________
   [ ] None of these apply


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: site
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - "Site C"
   - "Site_C"
   - "Site-A"
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - "site_c"
   - "site_c"
   - "site_c"


4. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

   Why not? (Check all that apply)
   [ ] I don't have any character/text variables
   [ ] My text variables are already clean
   [ ] My string issues are different from what this tutorial covers
   [ ] Other: ___________

TUTORIAL 2: CHECKING DATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[X] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any date-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [X] YES - Question #(s): 3
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 5


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [X] dmy() / ymd() / mdy() - parse dates in different formats
   [ ] excel_numeric_to_date() - convert Excel serial numbers
   [X] Checking for impossible dates (wrong day/month/year)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   [ ] None of these apply


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: collection_date
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - 2023-08-31
   - 2024-01-15
   - 2023-05-02
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - 2023-08-31
   - NA (outside stated study period)
   - 2023-05-02


4. Think about consequences:

   What assumption am I making about date format?
   That dates are recorded in YYYY-MM-DD format and represent the true sampling date.
   
   What could go wrong if this assumption is incorrect?
   Dates outside the study period could be mistakenly included, leading to incorrect
   seasonal or temporal interpretation.
   
   How could I verify my assumption is correct?
   By cross-checking the metadata description and confirming with the data collector
   or documentation.


5. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

   Why not?
   [ ] I don't have any date variables
   [ ] My dates are already in proper format
   [ ] My date issues are different from what this tutorial covers
   [ ] Other: ___________


================================================================================
TUTORIAL 3: CHECKING MISSING DATA PATTERNS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[X] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any missing data questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [X] YES - Question #(s): 4, 5
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway (missing data is common)


2. Which variables have the most missing data?

   Variable: eggs_hatched  | Percent missing: ~8.3%
   Variable: eggs_laid     | Percent missing: ~7.8%
   Variable: body_mass_mg  | Percent missing: ~7.3%


3. Missingness types checklist

   [ ] MCAR (Missing Completely At Random) - appears random/scattered
   [X] MAR (Missing At Random) - related to other observed variables
   [X] MNAR (Missing Not At Random) - related to the missing value itself

Why is it important to know what type of missing data we have?
Understanding the missing data mechanism determines whether complete-case analysis
is likely to be biased and whether missingness can be addressed using observed variables
or requires sensitivity analysis.

TUTORIAL 4: CHECKING DUPLICATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[X] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any duplicate-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [X] YES - Question #(s): 6
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway


3. Think about consequences:

   If I remove duplicates, what am I assuming?
   That each female_id should appear only once and any repeats are data entry errors.
   
   If duplicates are actually repeated measures, what should I do instead?
   [ ] Keep them - they're legitimate observations
   [X] Flag them for later analysis that accounts for non-independence
   [ ] Other: ___________


================================================================================
TUTORIAL 5: NUMERIC & CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[X] I completed the tutorial exercises


PART A: NUMERIC PLAUSIBILITY
-----------------------------

1. Did I identify any numeric plausibility questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [X] YES - Question #(s): 7


2. If YES, which numeric variable looks suspicious?

   Variable name: body_mass_mg
   
   Minimum value: -93  | Is this biologically possible? [ ] Yes [X] No [ ] Unsure
   Maximum value: 108.7 | Is this biologically possible? [X] Yes [ ] No [ ] Unsure
   

   Why do these look wrong?
   [X] Negative value (impossible for this measurement)
   [ ] Zero (should be NA instead)
   [ ] Too large (exceeds known biological maximum)
   [ ] Too small (below known biological minimum)
   [ ] Possible units confusion (mixed kg and g?)
   [ ] Other: ___________


PART B: CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY
-----------------------------------

4. Did I identify any cross-variable questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [X] YES - Question #(s): 8


5. Choose TWO variables that should be related:

   Variable 1: body_mass_mg
   Variable 2: eggs_laid
   
   What relationship do I expect between them?
   [X] Positive correlation (both increase together)
   [ ] Negative correlation (one increases, other decreases)
   [ ] Biological constraint (certain combinations impossible)
   [ ] Spatial constraint (certain combinations shouldn't occur)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   
   Describe the expected relationship:
   Larger female mosquitoes are expected to lay more eggs due to higher energetic
   and physiological capacity.


6. Think about consequences:

   If these variables are inconsistent, what should I do?
   [ ] Remove the observations
   [X] Convert one variable to NA (which one? body_mass_mg)
   [X] Flag for review but keep both
   [ ] Query the data collector
   [ ] Other: ___________
   
   Justification:
   Implausible mass values are likely data entry errors and should not influence
   biological inference.

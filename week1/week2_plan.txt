WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: Ria Abraham
Date: 2026-02-06

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description:
Inconsistent spelling and capitalisation of categorical variables creates artificial groups.

Which tutorial provides the solution:
Tutorial 1 – Checking strings

Which variable(s) affected:
site, treatment, collector

Why this is important to fix:
Inconsistent categories inflate group counts, distort summaries, and invalidate
comparisons between treatments and sites.

What I plan to do:
Standardise all character variables by converting to lower case and recoding
inconsistent labels to a single accepted form.


ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description:
Body mass contains biologically impossible negative values.

Which tutorial provides the solution:
Tutorial 5 – Numeric & cross-variable consistency

Which variable(s) affected:
body_mass_mg

Why this is important to fix:
Negative body mass values are biologically impossible and would bias any analysis
involving size, condition, or fecundity relationships.

What I plan to do:
Identify implausible values and convert them to NA before analysis.


OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- Missing egg counts that may be MAR or MNAR
- Dates outside the stated study period
- Possible repeated female_id values indicating repeated measures


QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. How to formally assess whether missing egg counts are MAR or MNAR.
2. Whether repeated female_id values represent true repeated measures.
3. Whether dates outside the study period should be excluded or corrected.
